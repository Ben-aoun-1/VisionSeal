# ðŸš¨ SECURITY VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED

## Issue: Exposed Authentication Token

**Severity**: HIGH
**Risk**: Unauthorized access to user accounts

## What Happened

1. Password reset email generated a recovery token
2. Token was exposed in URL parameters
3. Anyone with this URL can access the account
4. No additional password verification required

## Security Problems

1. **Token Exposure**: Authentication tokens should never be shared in plain text
2. **No Password Reset Flow**: User didn't actually reset password but gained access
3. **Session Hijacking Risk**: URLs can be logged, cached, or intercepted
4. **Long Token Expiry**: Token valid for 1 hour without password change

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Revoke Exposed Session
- The current session must be invalidated
- User should sign out immediately
- New secure authentication flow needed

### 2. Fix Authentication Flow
- Implement proper password reset with mandatory password change
- Remove token exposure from URLs
- Add proper session validation

### 3. Security Best Practices
- Never expose tokens in URLs or logs
- Implement proper token rotation
- Add session timeout controls
- Use secure redirect mechanisms

## Recommended Solution

1. **Immediate**: Sign out and clear session
2. **Short-term**: Use normal email/password authentication
3. **Long-term**: Fix Supabase configuration to require password change after reset

## Impact Assessment

- **Current Risk**: HIGH - Account can be accessed without proper authentication
- **Data Exposure**: Access to all tender data and user information
- **Business Risk**: Potential unauthorized access to platform

## Next Steps

1. Sign out immediately
2. Use proper email/password sign-in flow
3. Consider disabling password reset until properly configured
4. Implement secure authentication patterns

This vulnerability must be addressed before production deployment.
