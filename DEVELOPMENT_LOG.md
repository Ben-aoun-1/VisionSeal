#### Frontend Component Fixes
- **Missing Imports** - Added `useEffect` to React imports in SavedTenders component
- **Material-UI Components** - Added missing `CircularProgress` import for loading states
- **Component Rendering** - Fixed component crash preventing saved-tenders page from loading
- **Error Boundaries** - Resolved unhandled React errors in component lifecycle

#### Testing Completed
- **Authentication Flow** - Verified login/logout works without backend crashes
- **Saved Tenders API** - Confirmed all endpoints return proper responses instead of 500 errors
- **Frontend Loading** - Verified SavedTenders page loads correctly at /saved-tenders route
- **Backend Stability** - Confirmed no more authentication service crashes in error logs
- **End-to-End Flow** - Tested complete save/unsave tender workflow

#### Performance Improvements
- **Error Reduction** - Eliminated frequent 500 errors causing performance degradation
- **Backend Stability** - Removed authentication service crashes improving system reliability
- **Response Times** - Faster API responses due to eliminated error handling overhead
- **Frontend Loading** - Immediate page loading without component import errors

### Current Status
✅ **Authentication System**: No longer crashes on missing user profiles
✅ **Saved Tenders API**: All endpoints working with proper authentication
✅ **Frontend Components**: SavedTenders page renders correctly
✅ **Backend Stability**: Eliminated 500 errors from authentication service
✅ **User Experience**: Smooth authentication and saved tenders functionality
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper 401 responses instead of service crashes

### System Health Improvements
**Before Fixes:**
- ❌ Frequent 500 Internal Server Errors
- ❌ Authentication service unavailable errors
- ❌ SavedTenders page crashes with import errors
- ❌ Backend logs filled with NoneType attribute errors

**After Fixes:**
- ✅ Proper 401 authentication responses
- ✅ Stable authentication service operation
- ✅ SavedTenders page loads and functions correctly
- ✅ Clean backend logs with proper error classification

### Technical Details
**Authentication Error Root Cause:**
The `get_current_user` method assumed all authenticated users have profiles in the `user_profiles` table. When `_get_user_profile()` returned `None`, the code attempted to call `.get()` on `None`, causing the crash.

**Solution:**
Added conditional checking: `user_profile.get("status", "active") == "active" if user_profile else True`

**Saved Tenders User ID Fix:**
The auth service returns user data with key `user_id`, but the saved tenders router was accessing `current_user["id"]`, causing KeyError exceptions.

**Solution:**
Updated all saved tenders endpoints to use `current_user["user_id"]` consistently.

### Next Priority Items

#### Phase 2 Continued: User Profile Management
1. **Profile Management UI** - Create user profile editing interface
2. **Company Profile** - Detailed company information management  
3. **Account Settings** - User preferences and account configuration
4. **Password Change** - Secure password update functionality

#### System Monitoring & Stability
1. **Error Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive error tracking
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Add response time and error rate monitoring
3. **Health Checks** - Enhanced health check endpoints for system monitoring
4. **Logging Improvements** - Structured logging with correlation IDs

### Example Entry Format
```markdown
## 2024-01-16 - Authentication System Fixes

### Files Modified
- **src/core/auth/supabase_auth.py** - Fixed JWT token validation logic, added proper error handling for expired tokens
- **src/api/middleware/security.py** - Enhanced rate limiting middleware with per-user limits
- **src/core/config/settings.py** - Updated security settings with stronger password requirements

### Bug Fixes
- JWT token refresh not working properly - Fixed token validation in middleware
- Rate limiting applying globally instead of per-user - Added user-specific rate limiting

### Security Improvements

- Implemented proper session timeout - Sessions now expire after 24 hours of inactivity

### Testing
- Added unit tests for authentication flow - Covers login, logout, token refresh
- Added integration tests for protected endpoints - Ensures proper authorization

### Next Steps
- Complete file upload security implementation
- Add comprehensive audit logging for auth events
```
